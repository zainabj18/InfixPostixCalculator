Release Notes for the CS2800 Calculator

Calculator v1.0
13/12/2022

Modified design of the calculator by increasing the size of some of the text fields 
on the interface to make it easily readable.
Added print statements on the console that appear when an invalid expression is entered or 
when calculate button is pressed without entering an expression. 


Calculator v1.1
15/12/2022

Modified the buttons on the calculator so that if you now press one of the radio buttons
then press the other one, the first button you pressed will automatically 'unpress'. 
This improves the visual of the calculator as it will be much clearer which type of 
calculator it is called and what kind of expression you will enter.
